1. If you're using network mode and you have enabled user blogs, network-activate the plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

#### I still see some display names on my BP site! ####

* If you're using WP 3.0 in network mode and you're seeing display names on blog comments, please try following step 2 in the installation instructions.

The only place you should see a user's display name is on a member's profile, other than that if you notice a display name on any other page on BuddyPress, please let me know!


#### Internal configuration ####

By default, display names are enabled in the member header on profile pages.  If you prefer usernames to be shown, add the following snippet to your wp-config.php file:

`define( 'BP_SHOW_DISPLAYNAME_ON_PROFILE', false );`
